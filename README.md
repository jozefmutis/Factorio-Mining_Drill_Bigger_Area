# Factorio - Mining Drill Bigger Area
 
Changes Mining Drills to have customizable drilling area.

You may increase, or decrease area for ore searching. Ideal for 100% coverage beaconized mining (+smelting).

If you find any issues, feel free to open github issue - I will get notified via email. Please refrain from forking for small changes, I would rather accomodate your request then have people confused "which version is working in this patch".
